      <h4>
      I was inspired by how a city is developed the way a rural village becomes a town which in turn becomes a city that further develops into a higher tech city. I really thought about how the transition of building. This was by far the most challenging assignment yet. I decided todo a page on the overpopulation of cities and how they get overcrowded while the land begins to deplete with the overtake of buildings. What I think I could improve on this page is that I could add more statistics to give some more information and engagement. I did enjoy making the illustrations for this page since it finally gave me a chance to show off any skills I have pertaining to that. With that being said I think using JavaScript was the biggest challenge to me. I wish we had gotten to use more of the JavaScript earlier in class so that way I wasnâ€™t so confused later. I did find that knowing how to overlap elements, called parallaxing was something I had always wanted to learn and figuring it out was a great accomplishment. I am overall proud of this page but I do wish I could have added all the javascript elements that I wanted to originally add.
